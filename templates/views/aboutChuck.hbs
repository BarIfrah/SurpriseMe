        <p>Kanye Omari West (/ˈkɑːnjeɪ/; born June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, businessman, and fashion designer.
            He has been influential in the 21st-century development of popular music, mainstream hip hop, and general popular culture.
            Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West gained notoriety as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, 
            producing singles for several popular artists.
            Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, 
            West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music.
            He went onto experiment with a variety of musical genres on subsequent acclaimed albums, including Late Registration (2005),
            Graduation (2007), and 808s & Heartbreak (2008).
            Drawing inspiration from maximalism and minimalism respectively, his fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) 
            and sixth album Yeezus (2013) were also critical and commercial successes.
            West also diversified musical styles on The Life of Pablo (2016) and Ye (2018), and explored Christian music on Jesus Is King (2019).
            West's discography also includes the full-length collaborative albums Watch the Throne (2011)
